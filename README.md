## What is A Progressive App?
Progressive Apps are web applications that work regardless of a user's internet connection quality.<br>
A common problem occurs when users are left waiting for data and are literally left unaware of whether or not their application is working. <br>

## The Usual Pattern - and a Problem
When using a web app say, on a phone, a couple of things occur. Generally, the phone sends a request through wifi/cell towers, through the ISP, some proxies, and finally the destination (a server). Afterwards, the reverse occurs, and data renders on the phone - the application "works".<br>
However, several factors can break this pattern, such as - crowding, cell tower failure, and environmental occurences. Additionally, if any single step is affected, the end user will be affected and the app will seemingly be "broken", or in connection limbo.
